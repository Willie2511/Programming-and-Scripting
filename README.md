This repository contains a number of weekly tasks completed over the past three months.

1. The first task was to write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index. The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms. The output is their weight divided by their height in metres squared. This is a simple program which deals with basic user inputs.

2. The second weekly task was to write a program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order. A short piece of code was developed to achieve this.

3. The third task was to write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. This task was an introduction to inputs, loops and if statements. While the code was quite simple, it required careful thought and attention.

4. The fourth weekly task was to write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. This task introduced me to importing, and datetime. While the resulting code was realtively simple, using datetime and a loop, it was challenging as using datetime correctly required me to learn new code.

5. The fifth weekly task was to write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. 

6. The sixth weekly task was to write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. The text file downloaded was a passage from Moby Dick. This task required a more complex loop and line.split functions with which i was unfamiliar. It took a few unsuccessful attempts before I eventually completed the task. 

7. The seventh weekly task in the repository was to write a program that displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes.
